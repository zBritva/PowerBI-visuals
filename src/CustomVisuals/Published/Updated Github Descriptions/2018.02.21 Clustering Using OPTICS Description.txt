Brief Description:	
Use the density-based clustering algorithm OPTICS to analyze groups within a dataset.

Long Description:
Clustering using OPTICS by MAQ Software analyzes and identifies data clusters. The algorithm relies on density-based clustering, allowing users to identify outlier points and closely-knit groups within larger groups. This visual includes adjustable clustering parameters to control hierarchy depth and cluster sizes. R package dependencies (auto-installed): Dbscan, plotly, ggplot2.

Key features: 
•	Data is scaled and pre-processed automatically, eliminating the need to do so externally.
•	Hover tooltips and zoom effects.
•	Capability to manually adjust the parameters of the clustering model.
